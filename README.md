# Simply typed lambda calculus type checker

- Create a program in Haskell, that will type check given lambda calculus
expression, which may be (partially) annotated by user.
- Let the type checker infer types, where feasible

## Optional tasks

* [x] Implement evaluatoion
* [ ] Create REPL that will support all features implemented
* [x] Implement lambda calculus desugaring (as covered in BI-PPA)
* [ ] Let the type checker annotate the whole lambda expression

## Example usage

TBA
